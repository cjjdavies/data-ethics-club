# How to run a Data Ethics Club meeting

Typically we have a brief introduction to the material, split everyone into breakout rooms of 5-6 people for 25-30 minutes to talk about the discussion questions, and then come back together for the final 15-20 minutes to share thoughts before voting on the material for the next meeting. 

We use the collaborative markdown site [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) to collect everyone's views on the content whilst we're in breakout rooms. Our templates for this are linked below.  

## Roles and getting involved
We tend to have separate responsibilities split into facilitating and organising, and we swap these roles around each meeting.  
The **facilitator** is responsible for leading on the content,  managing the discussion in the meeting and writing up the summary of the meeting.  
The **organiser** is responsible for sending out emails, setting up the templates and managing participants and breakout rooms in the meeting.  
### I'd like to be an organiser of Data Ethics Club
We'd would love to hear from people interested in organising! Please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) and let us know. We'd especially like to hear from PhD students/early career researchers and people who are usually under represented in data science. 

### I'd like to lead a session on a particular topic
Brilliant! Please [email us](mailto:grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk) to let us know and we can set this up with you. 

## Before the meeting

### For facilitators
- [ ] Choose the material to discuss from the [reading list](./../READING-LIST.md). We suggest voting on this in the previous meeting!  
- [ ] Decide on three questions around the piece to discuss.  
- [ ] Create a [meeting information file](./../meetings/meeting_template.md) in the `meetings/` folder with links and the three discussion questions.
- [ ] Have a 3-minute verbal summary of the material ready in case nobody in the meeting is prepared to volunteer one.  

### For organisers
- [ ] Update the [meeting overview file](./../MEETINGS.md) with a link to the new meeting information page.
- [ ] Set up a new [HackMD document](./templates/HackMD_meeting_template.md) for collaborative writing in the meeting. To do this, we:
  - [ ] Create a new [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), copy in the [template](./templates/HackMD_meeting_template.md), and edit the links to this week's content.
  - [ ] Give the HackMD document a shortened name for easy sharing (open the share tab, edit the box to something like `DEC-bropenscience`, and click "save").
  - [ ] After editing, to sync the HackMD document to GitHub:
    - [ ] First save a version: go to `Options` (three dots) -> `Versions and GitHub sync` -> `Save as Version` -> name the version something descriptive (such as "setup" or "before meeting")
    - [ ] Second push to GitHub: click `Push to GitHub`. If you see a message about linebreaks, choose `Switch Now` (read more about that [here](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Flink-with-github)). Choose the repository and branch, and under `Select File`, choose to create a new file on GitHub with a name of the form `DD-MM-YY_writeup.md`.
  - [ ] **Make sure that the HackMD document has the right permissions** we turn on reading, writing and commenting for everyone, so that people don't need to sign in.
- [ ] Send a one-week reminder to the group with quick links to the online meeting, the reading material and the discussion questions. We usually also include a link to last week's discussion.   
- [ ] Send an on-the-day reminder to the group with quick links to the online meeting, the reading material and the discussion questions.  
- [ ] Make sure you have three choices from the reading list for attendees to vote on for the next meeting. You can make this decision  in advance, together with the facilitator or other organisers (see [organising](../organising.md) for some ideas on making these decisions). 

## Meeting Structure
Meetings are typically 1 hour.  
  
**0-5 mins**   
  ðŸŸ¢ Allow people to trickle in and say hi. 
  - You can use this time to link to the HackMD document and let people introduce themselves there.

**5-10 mins**   
  ðŸ‘‹ Welcome everyone to the meeting. 
  - Once everyone has arrived, invite a 3 minute summary of the content for discussion (not everyone will have had a chance to read it). If no one volunteers you may need to do this yourself!  
  - Post a link to the Code of Conduct and the HackMD collaborative document and do a quick reminder of any key points. For example, if there are new people, you can ask people to use the "put hand up" feature to answer if they read the paper this week. This is an opportunity to check if people can use the feature and a reminder to make space for people to talk. The introduction of the HackMD document serves as a reminder of what to say if you get lost.
  - Allocate people randomly into breakout rooms, with 5-6 people in each group.   

**10-40 mins**  
  ðŸ’¬ Everyone chats in their breakout rooms. Keep an eye on the main room for any latecomers who need to be assigned to a breakout room.  

**40-55 mins**  
  ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ Bring everyone back to the main room and invite summaries from each group. 
  Hopefully this will provoke some discussion (we usually find we run out of time because of it!). 
  The facilitator should chair this part of the meeting to make sure that all groups get a chance to feed back.

**55-60 mins**  
  ðŸ“Š Run a feedback poll.
  We usually ask:  
  - Did the material provoke interesting discussion?  
  - Would you recommend this piece to another group?  
  - Vote on what to discuss next time (from a shortlist).   

## After the meeting  
- [ ] Update the meeting information file with the outcome of the poll and a link to the summary document.  
- [ ] Move the meeting on the overall meeting list, and make the next one!  
- [ ] Sync the HackMD document with the repository to capture the discussion as it was written. 
- [ ] Edit the HackMD document into a summary of the meeting.
