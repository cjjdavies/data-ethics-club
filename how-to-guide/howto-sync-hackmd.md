# How to add and sync a new HackMD document

We use HackMD documents in meetings for people to record some of the main points coming out of the small group discussions. This is because we don't always have a facilitator in every room so its a way to make sure we still include all the groups discussions in our write up. 

- [ ] Create a new [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), copy in the [template](./templates/HackMD_meeting_template.md), and edit the links to this week's content.
- [ ] Give the HackMD document a shortened name for easy sharing (open the share tab, edit the box to something like `DEC-bropenscience`, and click "save").
- [ ] After editing, to sync the HackMD document to GitHub:
- [ ] First save a version: go to `Options` (three dots) -> `Versions and GitHub sync` -> `Save as Version` -> name the version something descriptive (such as "setup" or "before meeting")
- [ ] Second push to GitHub: click `Push to GitHub`. If you see a message about linebreaks, choose `Switch Now` (read more about that [here](https://hackmd.io/c/tutorials/%2Fs%2Flink-with-github)). Choose the repository and branch, and under `Select File`, choose to create a new file on GitHub with a name of the form `DD-MM-YY_writeup.md`.
- [ ] **Make sure that the HackMD document has the right permissions** we turn on reading, writing and commenting for everyone, so that people don't need to sign in.
