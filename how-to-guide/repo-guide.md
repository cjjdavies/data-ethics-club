# Guide to the Data Ethics Club Repository

## Overview
As you've likely noticed the Data Ethics Club is organised using a GitHub repository. The repository has the following structure:

- `README.md` - Information about what the group is, how to join and our contributors list.
- `READING_LIST.md` - Our data ethics reading list, which we accept contributions for at any time!
- `MEETINGS.md` - A overview list of previous and upcoming meetings, with links to the content and summaries we wrote.
- `code_of_conduct.md` - Our code of conduct, written specifically for an online discussion group context. 
- `agendas/` - Agendas for organisers meetings. 
- `meetings/` - Meeting information for every meeting we have had, organised by month. 
- `how-to-guide/` - Where you are now! More detailed information about how we organise the group, and how others could reuse the repo. 


## Using GitHub issues
We use [GitHub issues](https://www.github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues) to record actions for ourselves as organisers, which is why they're a great way to also collect reading list suggestions. We have an [issue template](./../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/reading-suggestion.md) specifically for reading list suggestions, and find it helpful to link this to the item in the [reading list](./../READING-LIST.md) so we know who suggested it, and any discussion questions they thought might be interesting.
