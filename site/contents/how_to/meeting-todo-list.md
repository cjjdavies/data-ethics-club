## One week before the meeting

- [ ] Set up a new [HackMD document](./templates/HackMD_meeting_template.md) for collaborative writing in the meeting. See instructions for this [here](./howto-sync-hackmd.md). 

## After the meeting  
- [ ] Update the meeting information file with the outcome of the poll and a link to the summary document.
