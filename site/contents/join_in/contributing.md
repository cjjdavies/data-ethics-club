# Contributing to our materials

The Data Ethics Club [repository]() is a hub of information where we collect the discussions we've had as a group, our reading list and information about our past or upcoming meetings. 
Our aim is for anyone to feel 

## What kinds of contributions are we looking for?

We're open to any suggestions on how to improve the Data Ethics Club resources, from increasing accessibility to changing the structure of our content. 
That said, we are particuarly open to additions for our [reading list]() - the data ethics landscape is pretty huge and so its a group effort keeping on top of new pieces and issues to consider. We welcome videos, blog posts, white papers or journal articles relating to ethics and data science - these can cover anything from be the impact of algorithms on the people who are deploying them, to the ethics of surveillance and buying/selling personal data, to a more technical paper on the specifics of an explainable AI algorithm.

## How can I contribute?

We accept contributions in a variety of ways. You could:  
* [Get in touch with us over email or Twitter](../contact)  
* Make a Pull Request to our repository  
* Open an issue with our [issue template](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club/issues/new?assignees=NatalieThurlby&labels=reading+suggestion&template=reading-suggestion.md&title=%5BSUGGESTION%28S%29%5D+You+suggestion%28s%29+here).  

We welcome any form of contribution so don't worry if you do not use GitHub, just get in touch with us however works for you and we'll be happy to hear from you.  

Usually if you are contributing to the reading list we will ask you to also provide three discussion points about the piece to help guide our discussion if we read (or watch/listen to) it for a Data Ethics Club meeting. You can look at our past meetings for an idea of the kinds of questions we consider.
