<!--Please don't edit the info panel below-->

```{admonition} What's this? 
This is summary of Wednesday 17th November's Data Ethics Club discussion, where we spoke about the article [Statistics, Eugenics and Me](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-eugenics-and-me-29eaf43efac7) by Raphael Sonabend.

The summary was written by Huw Day, who tried to synthesise everyone's contributions to this document and the discussion. "We" = "someone at Data Ethics Club". 
Nina Di Cara and Natalie Thurlby helped with a final edit.

## Introduction

The article outlines the experiences of the author as they studied in the Statistics department of University College London (UCL), which was the home, for decades, of the most prominent eugenicists. This was juxtaposed with the author having had many relatives murdered in the holocaust. As the author puts it:

"Much of my family was murdered in the holocaust as part of a regime to eradicate a supposed 'inferior race'. Yet, I still viewed Pearson, Fisher, and Galton (and others) as the Fathers of Statistics who deserved to be recognised and respected for their contributions. I had naïvely assumed they were a product of their time and that their research was a natural progression in the statistics behind genetics. This was not the case."

In this discussion, we considered the history of the relationship between statistics and eugenics, our awareness of this relationship (including how much it is talked about in formal education settings) and the potential pitfalls with hero worship both within and outside of academia; plaques, statues and buildings named after particular scientists.

## To what extent were you already aware of the relationship between statistics and eugenics?

We had a mixed discussion involving data scientists, genetic epidemiologists and philosophers as well as those with more general STEM backgrounds (physicists, mathematicians, engineers etc.)

Whilst the history of mathematics mentioned the relationship between statistics and eugenics, it was hardly (if at all) mentioned in mathematics lectures. It was certainly not included in GCSEs and A level syllabuses. Links to Darwinism might have been mentioned in the context of evolution, but the emphasis in STEM education has always been on the tools and their applications, not on their origins and inventors.

Those with a STEM background noted that the links between eugenics and statistics was not well taught, but not particuarly surprising either. Results are almost always attributed to their creator (e.g. Euler's Theorem) and occasionally quirky facts but typically not any of substance. Those with a background in genetic epidemiology knew a bit more about the links with eugenics.

We mused which parts of statistics would be changed by these views and whether interpretations of statistical results might have been reframed by the beliefs of some statisticians? Would statistical tools have been developed in the same way if they were being applied to different problems? Which problems people chose to apply these tools to inevitably affected which tools were developed first.

## Do you find the quotations provided by the author to be enough evidence to label the statisticians as supporters of racist or ablist eugenics? What other information do you find to be relevant?

Some might argue that perhaps the word genocide is being used too losely in this article. On the one hand, it seems overly pendantic to debate whether someone's pro-eugenics views constitute genocidal or not. There are certainly anti-semitic and racist views held by the people listed in the article which are deeply problematic. Why can't the term "genocide" apply to future potential generations (who would certainly be affected by eugenics now)? Regardless of this point, as readers, we expected a closer link evidenced between statistics and eugenics based on the title. 

It would be a good idea to mention these problematic views in context and have some nuanced discussion of the work built into the curriculum. Acknowledging the troubling views of a scientist, engineer or innovator can be done without deplatforming them. We recalled examples of lecturers who used pictures to identify named individuals and a few fun facts about someone. These things should be taught and known. 

How much did they say about certain views and how central were these sentiments in their work? If these views are held, it was likely that there would have been several incidences of them talking about it as opposed to one off quotes.

We talked about humans being complicated. Perhaps we should not glorify anyone. We conflate good science with people being good - a halo effect. There are many ways that we benefit now from unethical research, such as many developments in medicine. 

It remains and will always be important to listen to the people who are affected and ask their views on how this should be taught now. It is the responsibility of educators to make people aware, in particular with undergraduates who are mostly concerned with the next exam question, not googling who devised the statistical methods that they used. 

We have the right to be mad about not being taught these things and left to stumble across them, but really we need to work out how to communicate these things in the future using the power that we have now. Another good argument for being educated about these things is that we need to be able to talk constructively with the public about these topics, and so if we are not sufficiently educated to talk about it as 'experts' then it can damage our trust with the public. 

## How do you think that a researcher’s support of racist or ablist eugenics should impact the way their work is taught, or how their names are used for other purposes in research communities?

We asked oursleves: "Who deserves to be remembered?" in the context of statistics (and scientific discoveries more generally). Could other people have discovered p-values (for example) and not been a eugenist? Was it the motivation of studying eugenics that lead to these tools being developed? Many of us who had studied STEM subjects in higher education noticed a culture of objectivity, where it is seen as wrong and not important to delve into the who, what, why? There seems to be a separation of statistics from its social context.

Do we stop using the tools just because someone racist made it? No. We need to separate the work from the people whilst still acknowledging their problematic views. Finding ways to use statistical tools/methods in ways that *counter* eugentics/racism , that is, using them as tools for justice, would be a way to honour the accomplishments of the methods, and not the individuals who devised them.

One extreme suggestion would be renaming the methods, but are we honouring a person by naming a method after them, or simply acknowledging who first documented it? Indeed this approach seems to be attempting to forget/disregard the past rather than confront it. Instead the general consensus was that we should continue this idea of acknowledging someone's contribution to the field, regardless of their problematic ideas, whilst acknowledging and talking about those ideas. What ideas did they have? Why are they problemtic? How did those ideas potentially contribute to their innovations in this field?

An example from philosophy is Martin Heideger, who is best known for contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism. He was also a member of the Nazi Party and there is [controversy as to the relationship between his philosophy and his Nazism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger_and_Nazism). This is an ongoing discussion of how much his views affected his philosophy.

We can see a case for, as part of a course (not a doom and gloom lecture and you should feel bad for using their methods). Having a general lecture on the history of things, the good and bad rather than focussing on the specific things.

What do we make of the defense "they were a product of their times"? You should still be able to call someone out, even if their ideas were a product of their culture. This does not rule out them having other, good ideas. Should a professor who has discriminatory views be allowed to hold their post? In the past, yes. Nowadays, less so. We discussed previously about wanting to decolonise academia and the push for more diversity in academia. Linking in to our previous discussion on [decolonising computer science](https://very-good-science.github.io/data-ethics-club/contents/write_ups/2021/20-10-21_writeup.html), how can we hope for more diverse individuals to progress through academia if the very people they look up don't want them there? 

It's a form of regulation that has its place in society. There are many talented people in society who are not good people, but they are held accountable by some degree. Some would argue not enough. Free speech is important in an intellectual community but that doesn't mean people shouldn't expect consequences to the things they say and how they act. If your opinion is denying the existence of some of your students (in the case of transphobia) then should you be allowed to teach them? Most of us thought, no, you shouldn't.

Within university, there are some that feel you can't express opinions regardless of your intent. They would point out that you don't have the right to be offended. Should there be more guidelines on legality of freedom of speech, with some legal framework dictating how free our speech is versus how much of a right we have to offend or be offended? Or should we rely on the good will of people to reduce offense caused? Most of us were uneasy about the idea of the policing freedom of speech in this but we all agreed that relying on the good will of people clearly is not sufficient.

If we can hear you complaining about being cancelled, you haven't been cancelled. People underestimate what abuse online/on social media can mean to some people, even if there isn't yet a legal framework to say causing offense is wrong.

## On the issue of naming statues after people and the parallels with land acknowledgement

We had an involved discussing about naming a building/statue celebrating a person versus acknowledging their contribution. The author was still going to continue learning about and applying these methods whilst knowing they were learning these things in a building named after someone who didn't want them to exist.

Human beings are very complex, and so maybe we shouldn't glorify anyone with buildings or statues or awards. Granted, the "Standard Deviation Tower" doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Gary Young from the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/jun/01/gary-younge-why-every-single-statue-should-come-down-rhodes-colston) wrote "every single statue should come down". Statues of animals can stay. This would be an interesting way of taking the emphasis away from the individual and putting more focus on the collective effort of scientific achievement.

One member of the group reminded us that Jimmy Saville had several statues in his honor. As this [letter](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2021/11/29/would-you-keep-public-monuments-honouring-the-late-jimmy-savile) notes: "No one would argue that removing statues of the sex criminal is 'cancelling culture', yet this logic is routinely used to defend monuments of slavers." 

Sometimes we want to use people's work without citing them (the person and all that they were/are). We want to cite the concept instead. Maybe the solutions is to write a footnote. There is a similar convention to the [Acknowledgement of indigenous land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_acknowledgement). "A land acknowledgement or territorial acknowledgement is a formal statement, often spoken at the beginning of a public event, that it is taking place on land originally inhabited by or belonging to indigenous peoples." 

This practice has been common in Australia since the early 2000s, picked up more in Canada since around 2015 and has started catching on in the USA as of around 2020. Is this just be ticking another box? Is it better to start with something than nothing at all?

Is it a question of who benefits? If people are currently able to benefit then it might make sense to be less keen to cite those people. However, we're at a time as humans where we conflate good science with that *person* being good - the 'halo' effect. 

We *all* benefit from research that has been done unethically - the whole medical field for example. We don't want to condone them, but we don't want to tie ourselves in knots feeling sorry for things that happened in the past. It would be good if we could forget the people and take forward the useful techniques and methods, but what do we lose by not teaching the history? We have the issue of throwing out the baby with the bath water. 

How much time must pass for us to be able to move on? Simply forget the person but keep their progress on whatever concept/method/theory etc.? 

Who is still being negatively impacted today by the morally questionable views of these forefathers? For example, the direct impact is still felt in Australia today by the living survivors of the Stolen Generation. Eugenics was entrenched eugenics was in [recent Australian history](https://theconversation.com/eugenics-in-australia-the-secret-of-melbournes-elite-3350). (See also [Australian Eugenics From 1900 to 1961](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/63658/NinaLemieuxSeniorThesis.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y).)

Another opinion piece objects to the bringing down of statues of [Sir Ronald Fisher](https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/march-2021/cancelled-by-his-college/). Fisher is commemorated with a blue [plaque](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/ronald-aylmer-fisher/) on the gate-pier of Inverforth House, North End Way, Hampstead, where he lived as a child between 1896 and 1904. "Sir RONALD AYLMER FISHER 1890-1962 Statistician and Geneticist lived here 1896-1904". There is no mention of eugenics in the admittedly small plaque, whilst there is plenty of mention of it in the article below. Should his pivotal role in the field of eugenics (extensively detailed in the linked article) be acknowledged? Is the fact that the field of eugenics is now discredited as a legitimate field of science (as acknowledged in the article) the reason that the title of "eugenicist" was not included? 

## What change would you like to see on the basis of this piece? Who has the power to make that change?

Based on this piece, we would like to see teaching on social context included/embedded it learning scientific methods. This will be hard in practice, both to train teaching staff and to embed interdisciplinary work in STEM subjects.

In the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Bristol, we are starting to see grass roots activism to decolonise the curriculum, ranking the teaching with a traffic light system by 'white lens'. This is student led action to influence the lecturers. The syllabus could include something about this! It goes hand in hand with decolonising the syllabus. If any of us are in a teaching position we have the power to do something about this. But we cannot just put the onus on the teachers/lecturers/tutors to prepare lectures that sensitively acknowledge an unethical past. This requires time, effort and materials. We need to be supported to be able to do this well.

One member made a really good point that naming buildings after scientists/making statues of them fuels the “lone rockstar” view of scientists. Whilst in the past, this idea might have been more prevelant, by today's standards, it encourages a view that is unrealistic (and arguably incompatible) for the next generation of scientists and academics.

This debate comes down to a question of separating "art" from "artist" which can be somewhat at odds with the academic tradition of acknowledging the work of those who came before us. We should endeavour to celebrate people's acts, not necersarily the people themselves.

To work in the field of data science is to work in the shadow of eugenics. Acknowledging and learning from this could better inform how we go about innovations in the future, as well as reminding us of the imperfections of various academic role models.
