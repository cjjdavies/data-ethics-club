## What does it mean to decolonise something?

We discussed [Towards decolonising computational sciences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14258.pdf), a paper by Abeba Birhane and Olivia Guest. As the authors set out in the abstract: 

"This article sets out our perspective on how to begin the journey of decolonising computational fields, such as data and cognitive sciences. We see this struggle as requiring two basic steps: a) realisation that the present-day system has inherited, and still enacts, hostile, conservative, and oppressive behaviours and principles towards women of colour (WoC); and b) rejection of the idea that centering individual people is a solution to system-level problems."

We can see what solutions the paper offers for solving problems and use that as a starting point for what the paper means by decolonising academia.

There are systems of oppression and power imbalances in academia and we want to get rid of those systems so that everyone is equally welcome and people are systematically treated better. This is the prevailing power of colonialism – in terms of knowledge, especially in education and academia. Decolonisation requires a willingness to give up and share power.

Decolonising academia could involve addressing power structures that exist due to colonialism and confronting them. Perhaps it relates to post-colonial theory and frameworks.

Decolonising could mean to become independent, and also to undo the effects of colonisation. Decolonisation is huge with farreaching ramifications. It is everything about our systems - school, politics. This framework needs to be dismantled to strive towards decolonisation.

## How can we start decolonising academia?

One suggestion was that, as a starting point, we can aim to reach a point where systemic discrimination is eliminated. Then the only discrimination left is from racist people. Then we can just weed those people out. 

This would involve eliminating leftover structures of decision making from colonial times. If you have small bias against a marginalised group, even if your initial recruitment pool is diverse, several rounds of promotion later and there's hardly any of the marginalised group left.

We need to to encourage inclusion, equality, diversity whilst withdrawing from colonial structures. This leads us to question: can we address colonialism in academia without decolonising all of society? Should we approach this problem top-down or bottom-up?

This is going to take a lot of time. As an example, Australian education slowly shifted from cherry picking colonial pride moments to including full history and perspectives (arrival vs invasion).

People get fussy about quotas, but then when we see 2 in 5 students being women at the undergraduate level and then only 1 in 20 at the PhD level, we see this problem materialising.

As a concrete example of this 2.1% of professors in the UK are BAME Women - 25 of +21,000 are black women.

If no one is checking your bias, even if it's accidental (non-malicious), then you're just going to end up with this structural problem.

People who are vocally racist or misogynist can often be caught using a psuedo scientific mode of reasoning. Examples include: [The Google memo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber), eugenics etc. Psuedo science is inherently linked to discrimination, but this link is not clear to the uninformedNeed more history to teach about it.

It can definitely be good to do outreach and decolonising in earlier education, but some of us are a little bit skeptical of when people who suggest that. But sometimes because it can come across as reducing it to a pipeline problem (e.g. “how can we get black people/women to choose to do this subject?”).

How do you even get into positions of power without agreeing with the status quo? How do we dismantle something, without instituting another problematic framework in its place?

Is it easier to dismantle something from within? Or is that becoming complicit in the process?

There's this expectation to have "World leading papers" - completely entrenched colonialism in how the University measures research output quality etc. Language - publishing papers in English - also code even for open-source apps

Knowledge in general is colonialised - how can universities/individuals in medium- and low-income countries afford access to extortionate journal fees etc?


## What did you find the most and least persuasive argument in this paper?

The article certainly didn't pull any punches with its view of academia. Whether or not this is extreme cynicism or just unapologetically candid realism is one qusetion, but it is certainly persuasive.

It was a little patronising in parts, in some ways implying only the authors can see through the hegemony and that those who've done well have had to bow down to the system. Compromise is often required to assimilate into the system, but it's unfair to imply that it's always done unknowingly.

The link between psuedo science and discrimination wasn't super clear initially, but as soon as you bring in eugenics, it becomes more clear. Are flat earthers inherently racist?

What was a little concerning was the implication that you can’t trust the black people who have been successful in academia. You can understand what they point they were trying to make but iit felt to me like when in feminism people think there’s only one way to do it. We expect we’d agree with the authors if we actually discussed it, but in this aspect the point was clumsily made.

“Black women, through years of training and enculturation in a white supremacist and colonialist system, are conditioned to internalize the status quo. They may thus be unable to describe and elucidate the systems that oppresses them… They might lack the language to articulate it” 

Ironically, this itself seems to be an inherently patronising statement - are the authors seriously suggesting that anyone else apart from themselves are unable to see the problems with the system?

Additionally, the authors' argument is unprovable (although, to be clear, not necessarily wrong), any attempt by a Black Woman to oppose it can be deflected by stating that that person has been “assimilated” or by stating that they "haven’t educated themselves".

The authors sum up a more nuanced point “Ultimately, decolonising a system needs to go hand-in-hand with decolonising oneself”, acknowledging individual agency,  following their earlier persuasive point “centering individual people, as opposed to tackling systemic obstacles, is a myopic modus operandi and indeed part of the way the current hegemony maintains itself. Fundamental change is only possible by promoting work that dismantles structural inequalities and erodes systemic power asymmetries”.

The mention of including the history of what you are learning in what you’re learning. Although perhaps this feeling on history was confirmation bias from our primarily academic viewpoint.

Mentioning psuedo science was also important. Springer Link published a lot of psuedo science, need more onus on editors to weed that out.

There seems to be a lack of intersectionality in the paper because we need to address everything, not just discrimination against white women, for example. The paper primarily focuses on black women/women of colour, which means a lack of inclusion of Asian, Latina, Indigenous women - should they not be included in the decolonising debate? Some might argue it didn't go far enough in condemning the capitalist structure in which academia itself exists.

The main issue wasn't the argument themselves, the paper almost skimmed over explaining. The paper tried to cover a lot of stuff without explaining much, using citations to cover their backs.

Some points were too general, generalisation about academia. It was almost like a review paper on academia.

Unfortunately, you can't say everything in one paper, as it was only 10 pages long. Perhaps the paper could have been served by an acknowledgement of its focus (and by extension a mention of what it did not cover).

## What could you/your organisation do to decolonise your field?

For those of who us who have already made an effort, many of the things we try to do feel small and feel meaningless. Even small things get pushback, (e.g. listing pronouns in email signatures). 

Perhaps, once you reach a point where people start protesting, then maybe you're on the right track. But the most important thing always has been and always will be to listen to people. Unfortunately, this is not always easily done with one or two voices dominating such conversations (one member of our group suggested a mute button for *other people* in zoom meetings).

UKRI Ethnicity Data published gives us an understanding of how prominent certain groups. This could help inform policy change which could make a significant difference. In the mean time, individuals can look to educate ourselves and have discussions such as these. Understanding your own privelidge goes a long way to helping you check it.

Who drives values in academia? We see ourselves as 'left' but academia upholds right wing values. Funding probably plays a role in this. 

Where does the influence of funding sit with this topic? If we want to keep our research going, we need to toe the line to get funding grants. Until you explicity describe a system you don't realise a bias exists. 

Make this work (of decolonialisation) an integral part of each job role. Such work shouldn’t be done on top of a system that is itself inherently more-taxing for those that are oppressed: “these issues are difficult to acknowledge for those in power — they are seen as a sideshow, a political/politicised distraction rather than an essential element of good (computational) science.” 

This work should be valued in and of itself, not as a side hustle! 

"The system itself needs to be rethought — scholars should not, as a norm, need to form grassroots initiatives to instigate retractions and cleanup the literature. Rather, the onus should fall on those producing, editing, reviewing, and funding (pseudo) scientific work."

"Strict and clear peer review guidelines, for example, provide a means to filter racist pseudoscience out."

Start with small discussions and form a ripple effect as we take the ideas out further. Hold/participate in workshops/discussions that are non-judgemental and learning environments. It can be worrying to think you may say the wrong thing, so understanding the right way 

Calling out your own mistakes (for individuals *and* institutions) is a start, and helps open up these conversations.Collective action such as join a Union (e.g. UCU and pay inequality) can have a positive impact. We shouldn't let striving for perfection get in the way of progress, again as individuals or entire institutions.
